# CoffeeInOffice
A short program to find the nearest coffee machine in your office

A friend applied for a junior software engineer job, and they gave him this problem to work out.
So I'm trying my hand at it, and wrote it in Python.  I'm curious to see in what ways it could be improved.

I'm given a grid that represents the layout of an office, and the location of walls and coffee machines.
The data supplied to the program is: # of columns, # of rows, location of walls in the office, location of coffee machines in the office, and location of your desk.  The rest of the "cells" are desks, and you can move freely through them.  
The data you get back is the distance to the closest coffee machine.
